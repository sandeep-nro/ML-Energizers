# ML-Energizers
Singularity Hackathon 2023 
Proof of concept (POC)

Study using Automatic ML function part of Azure ML Studio 

ML/Model-Heating - VotingEnsemble algorithm. NMRSE = 0.01808, looking at Thermal Comfort deviation and possible causes by using historical data from multiple sensors and location weather API.

ML/Power Consumption - StackEnsemble algorithm, NMRSE = 0.04507, looking at electricity power consumtion and usage, correlating with historical data from multiple sensors and location weather API.
